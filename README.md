# Maps Vega Yeoman Generator

This is a [Yeoman Generator](https://yeoman.io/generators/) to create project for a statically served data visualization page.

By default, the page includes typescript creating a sample [Leaflet Map](https://leafletjs.com/) and [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/) chart. 

## Instructions

To use this generator you will need Yeoman installed with Node.js

```
npm install -g yo
```
This generator is NOT listed in npm. So you will need to install it yourself with 

```
npm install -g URL_TO_GIHUB_REPO
```
with that done, in the directory where you would like your project. 


```
yo maps-vega-viz
```

and follow the prompts.
